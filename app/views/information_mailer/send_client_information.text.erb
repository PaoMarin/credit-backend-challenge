Hello Sergio, check the following information that a potential client consulted for a loan request:

<% if @client.frecuency == 1 %>
  <% @frecuency = "monthly" %>
<% else %>
  <% @frecuency = "biweekly" %>
<% end %>

  Client data:

    Name: <%= @client.name %>
    Email: <%= @client.email %>
    Total Ingress: <%= @client.totalIngress %>
    Sector: <%= @client.sector %>
    Work Years: <%= @client.workYears %>
    Amount: <%= @client.amount %>
    Frecuency of payment: <%= @frecuency %>
    Paytime: <%= @client.paytime %>


  According to the data entered by the client, the calculation would be as follows:

  The client would pay a couta of $<%= @calculation %> <%= @frecuency %> during <%= @client.paytime %> months.
